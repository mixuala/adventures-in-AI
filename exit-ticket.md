> what the audience should walk away with

finding patterns in data and make predictions
touching every corner of your life, (you can run but you can't hide)
AI beats humans at...
why does it work? why now?
	
	data data data
	life in n-dimensions (1e9)
	everything is a probability
peek behind the curtains
	
	data: everything is a number
	perceptrons are the atoms of AI
	a race to the bottom: loss equations & gradient descent
	putting it all together
	
lifecycle: train-test-deploy-repeat
there is a model for everything
	
	data, vision, text, sound, games,
	feed-forward, CNN, RL, GANs
	


ethics: what decisions are inappropriate?
