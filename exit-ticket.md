> what the audience should walk away with

finding patterns in data and make predictions
touching every corner of your life, (you can run but you can't hide)
AI beats humans at...
why does it work? why now?
	
	data data data
	life in n-dimensions (1e9)
	everything is a probability
peek behind the curtains
	
	data: everything is a number
		supervised vs unsupervised learning
	perceptrons are the atoms of AI
	a race to the bottom: loss equations & gradient descent
	putting it all together
	
lifecycle: train-test-deploy-repeat
different models for different tasks
	
	data, vision, text, sound, games,
	feed-forward, CNN, time-based, RL, GANs
	
what did it learn?
	
	interpretability: attribution, disentanglement
	
ethics and AI 
	
	where did you get that data?
	was it biased?
	what decisions are (in)appropriate?
	what's the right decision?
