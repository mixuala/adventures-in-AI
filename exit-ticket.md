AI > ML > Deep Learning: Why is it trending?!??

	Machine learning is: finding patterns in data and make predictions
	touching every corner of your life, (you can run but you can't hide)
	AI beats humans at...

(??? this could be better) why does it work? why now?
A peek behind the curtains:
	
	data data data
	life in n-dimensions (1e9)
	everything is a probability
	
A peek behind the curtains
	
	data: everything is a number
		supervised vs unsupervised learning
	perceptrons are the atoms of AI
	a race to the bottom: loss equations & gradient descent
	putting it all together
	
lifecycle: train-test-deploy-repeat
different models for different tasks
	
	data, vision, text, sound, games,
	feed-forward, CNN, time-based, RL, GANs
	
what did it learn?
	
	not sure
	interpretability: attribution, disentanglement
	edge cases
	
ethics and AI 
	
	where did you get that data?
	was it biased?
	what decisions are (in)appropriate?
	what's the right decision? 
		fairness, accountability, transparency,
