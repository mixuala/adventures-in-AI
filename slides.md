# outline
1. AI > machine learning > deep learning
	- machines are making decisions using "A.I." that affect you every day, examples:
		- **today:** social media feeds, snapchat filters, Siri/Alexa, Google Translate, Portrait mode, Face ID, recommender engines, online advertising, grammarly
		- **tomorrow:** self-driving cars, medicine

2. What is it?
	CS: tell a computer what to do by programming it step-by-step
	ML: teach a computer to make predictions by learning hidden patterns in data
	
		> decision: action based on predictions
		
3. What does that looks like?

> show example of inference


> example of transfer learning, train on a dataset





4. How does this really work? (a simple example)

> show logistic neuron.  too much detail?
> datasets + pre-trained models = transfer learning

		1. datasets and benchmarks
			* CiFAR, ImageNet
		2. pre-trained models and embeddings
			* image recognition
			* BERT, word2vec
			* RL
			* GANS
		3. transfer learning

5. Behind the curtain (more detail)
	* **learning lifecycle:** train/validate/test/deploy
	* supervised vs. unsupervised learning 
	* loss equations determine what is learned
	* learning with gradient descent

	* 

6. Why does this work? 
	* life in n-dimensions
		* dimensionality reduction video
	* data, data, data
		* bias and variance: overfitting is bad
	* Petaflop/sec-day

7. different models for different tasks
	- feed forward
	- CNN
	- RL
	- GANS
	- RNN/LSTM/attention

8. how do you teach the right things?

> ImageNet: learning breakthroughs by model architecture
> 
9. It's an art, not a science
	- ImageNet breakthroughs
	- path of new ideas
10.
